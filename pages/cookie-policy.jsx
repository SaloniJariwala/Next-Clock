                                    service you have requested. An example of this would be a

                                    <strong>2. Analytics</strong> – We use analytics cookies to
                                    help us understand how users engage with our website. An
                                    example is counting the number of different people coming to
                                    our website or using a particular feature, rather than the
                                    total number of times the site or feature is used. Without
                                    this cookie, for instance, we would count you as three
                                    separate users if you visited the site three different times,
                                    making it difficult to analyze how well our website is
                                    performing or improve it without these cookies in place.

                                    <strong>3. User Cookies</strong> – We use these cookies to
                                    improve your experience by remembering your preferences so we
                                    know how you like to use our website. Examples of this would
                                    be remembering you so that you are served with the same
                                    content or to remember you when you come back to the site.

                                    networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Google+.
                                    Examples would be if you wanted to “like” or “tweet” about us
                                    or our products and/or services. Please see the “Third Party

                                    <strong>5. Interest-based Advertising</strong> – You will have
                                    noticed that when you visit websites, you are shown adverts
                                    for products and services you may wish to purchase. The money
                                    made by website owners for showing third party adverts on
                                    their websites often pays for the cost of running the website
                                    and therefore usually allows you to use the website without
                                    having to pay a registration or usage fee. To try to ensure
                                    that the adverts you see are relevant to you, third-party
                                    cookies may be used to collect information about the types of
                                    things that interest you. For example, websites you visit and
                                    the geography you are based in may play a factor in the
                                    adverts you see. Having these cookies does not increase the
                                    number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes them
                                    more relevant to you. Please see our “Third Party Cookies”
                                    section below for more details.
